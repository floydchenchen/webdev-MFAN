            <p>Minnesotaâ€™s metro cities and counties do not operate in a vacuum. We operate in a regional economy that drives the success of the state. MFAN is comprised of over 400 food systems partners from the seven-county metro region who seek to advance equitable access to healthy food for everyone in the region. We come together to learn, connect, and take collective action through policy and systems approaches that advance our mission.</p>
            <h3 class="my-3 text-primary">Your donation makes an immediate impact</h3>
            <p>MFAN is an inviting, innovative, and fun network seeking to advance a bold mission of equitable access to healthy food for all. Your donation will be used to support the network by funding supplies such as food, childcare, and room rental for meetings as well as providing stipends for partners to provide leadership to emerging Action Teams.</p>
